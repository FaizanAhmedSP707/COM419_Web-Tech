                > When a button is clicked inside a form that submits data, a '?' appears next to the URL of the page
                  This is known as a query selector
                > The <input> tag creates a text-box in which data can be entered
                > It's common to add a 'name' attribute to form inputs (such as textboxes); this will come in handy
                  when looking at server side code
                > When submitting a form, the webpage will take the value inscribed in the name attribute
                  (i.e. the thing in the speech markes) and prefix it to the data submitted by the user after the ? mark
                  in the URL like so: Name=Dario&email=dsv.123@yahoo.com .This is used by servers to identify what data has
                  been sent to it and what type of data it is.
                > Putting 'type' inside a <input> tag will restrict the input data to the type specified
                > radio buttons is where you select a single option from several options shown (not a drop down list)
                  (A circle next to the option gets highlighted with usually a blue/black colour when the circle is
                  clicked)

                  Otherwise, they will act independently of each other and you can select values at once.
                > The radio buttons have a "value." This is what will be sent to any script that processes the data
                  sent by the form.
                > The 'required' attribute makes the current field display a message to the user indicating that
                  they need to fill in that field, or click on one of the options, etc.
